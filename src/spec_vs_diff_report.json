  "summary": "Most REQ-11–REQ-15 items appear implemented: ReplaceableImage now supports empty upload placeholders with client-side preview; pages use the placeholder (no default src); Gujarati content is centralized/updated with owner name, work-from-home, hours, phone tel: links, address lines; Services shows 6 items with per-card image placeholders; Important Note appears on Home and Services. Potential gaps remain around the strict \"no default illustration/icon image\" interpretation and Gujarati-only visible text.",

      "reason": "Multiple pages and the placeholder UI itself still render Lucide icons (e.g., ImageIcon/Upload/Phone/Clock/MapPin/CheckCircle) by default, which may violate the acceptance criterion that no default illustration/icon images are displayed by default.",
